### Preview

Finding how NFL teams' host cities' climates impact their performance in extreme weather games.

### Objectives

The purpose of this project is to determine if the climate of National Football League teams' host cities impacts that team's performance in extreme weather games.  
Data from NFLSavant.com detailed the outcome of every NFL game from 1970 to 2013 along with the weather from that game.  I decided to split the results of NFL games up between the approximately 1000 coldest games played during this time frame, with the approximately 1000 warmest games played.  These bounds were 33 degrees Fahrenheit and colder and 73 degrees Fahrenheit.  To overcome biases for teams that are just historically better/worse, the difference in win percentage of normal weather games (between 34 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit) with the cold games and the hot games win percentages.  I will visualize these results along with figuring out if there is any correlation between host city's warmest average monthly high and coldest average monthly low during the NFL season with their win percentages in different weather.  


### Data Inport

```{r}
#getting data in from NFL Savant
NFLweather <- read_excel("C:/2022 Fall/STAT 5014 Stat Program Packages/Project/weather_20131231.xls")
attach(NFLweather)
#View(NFLweather)
```


### Data Preparation

From the original data, I summed each franchise's total wins, losses, and ties, and calculated their win percentage.  

```{r}
#creating empty vectors to add more data to set
homewin = c()
awaywin = c()
homeloss = c()
awayloss = c()
hometie = c()
awaytie = c()

#to show who won each game
for (i in 1:nrow(NFLweather)) {
    if (home_score[i] > away_score[i]) {
        homewin[i] = 1
        awaywin[i] = 0
        homeloss[i] = 0
        awayloss[i] = 1
        hometie[i] = 0
        awaytie[i] = 0
    }
    if (home_score[i] < away_score[i]) {
        homewin[i] = 0
        awaywin[i] = 1
        homeloss[i] = 1
        awayloss[i] = 0
        hometie[i] = 0
        awaytie[i] = 0
    }
    if (home_score[i] == away_score[i]) {
        homewin[i] = 0
        awaywin[i] = 0
        homeloss[i] = 0
        awayloss[i] = 0
        hometie[i] = 1
        awaytie[i] = 1
    }
}

#adding status of game wins to data
NFLweather1 = data.frame(cbind(NFLweather, homewin, awaywin, homeloss, awayloss, hometie, awaytie), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

#adding wins/losses/ties per team
teams = aggregate(NFLweather1$homewin, by=list(Category=NFLweather1$home_team), FUN=sum)[ , 1]
wins = aggregate(NFLweather1$homewin, by=list(Category=NFLweather1$home_team), FUN=sum)[ , 2] + aggregate(NFLweather1$awaywin, by=list(Category=NFLweather1$away_team), FUN=sum)[ , 2]

winpct = wins / (wins + losses) #calculating win percentage for franchise history

#all time team records
records = data.frame(cbind(teams, wins, losses, ties, round(winpct, 3)))
colnames(records) = c("Team", "Wins", "Losses", "Ties", "Win %")
records
```

### Data Summarization

I repeated the process above with conditions of the coldest and hottest thousand games in NFL history, along with the most extreme 250 hottest and coldest.  I compiled each franchises' records in each of the weather conditions (Extreme Cold, Cold, Normal, Hot, Extreme Hot).  I finally compiled a table of just the win percentages for each franchise in each of the weather conditions and included the average annual temperature, coldest monthly low from the months of September to February, and the highest monthly high temperature from the months of September to February.  

```{r}

### Transformations

Because temperature are on a different scale than the difference of win percentage, I standardized temperature to be within the range of the differences of win percentages.

```{r}
#temperatures are on a much different scale than win%, so I standardized the temperatures and added them to the data
s.temp = (diffTable3$Temp - mean(diffTable3$Temp)) / (50 * sd(diffTable3$Temp))
s.tempH = (diffTable3$TempH - mean(diffTable3$TempH)) / (50 * sd(diffTable3$TempH))
s.tempC = (diffTable3$TempC - mean(diffTable3$TempC)) / (50 * sd(diffTable3$TempC))

diffTable4 = data.frame(cbind(diffTable2, as.numeric(s.tempH), as.numeric(s.tempC)))
colnames(diffTable4) = c("Team", "XC", "C", "N", "H", "EH", "s.tempH", "s.tempC")
```


### Data visualization 

I used ggplot to visualize the data.  I did a barplot on the difference of win percentages, putting them in order from the best performers in that weather to the worst performers in that weather compared to normal weather games.  To show the impact of the host city's temperature, I added dots to the barplot of the standardized host city temperatures; for the cold weather performance barplot, I used the host city's lowest monthly average low temperature during the NFL season and the same for warm weather.

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=10}

    geom_point(data = diffTable4, aes(x = reorder(Team, N, na.rm = TRUE), y = 4 * s.tempH), col = "red", alpha = 0.7)


```

These ggplots do not format well in RMarkdown, so I will attach them separately.  However, it can be seen that more teams located in cold cities (represented by the blue dots) have a improved win percentage in cold weather (bars tend to the right for these cities).  More of the warmer cities tend in the worse performances.  In the normal temperature graph, the temperature dots appear scattered as expected.  Finally, in the hot weather graph, dots again appear pretty scattered, hinting at no relationship between win percentage in hot games and host city high temperatures.  


### Correlation Analysis

With these visualizations, I want to quantify the relationship between host city temperature and extreme weather game performance.

There appeared to be a pretty strong inverse relationship between host city's coldest temperatures and the team's performance during cold weather games, with the correlation between the two variables being -0.63.  For games played in temperatures between 34 and 73 degrees, there was still a much lower correlation between the two, at -0.24.  This number is expected to be lower since in theory there should not be advantages in normal weather for NFL teams located in extreme weather cities.  Finally, the same was found for warm weather which is interesting.  The correlation between win percentage in hot weather with the host city's highest monthly average high during the NFL season is 0.23.  These results show that cold weather teams may have an advantage in cold weather games, but not as much for teams based in other climates.


### Modeling

I next wanted to quantify the linear relationship between the NFL host city's winter weather with the team's win percentage in games colder than 33 degrees Fahrenheit.  The following shows result from a simple linear regression model.  

```{r}
#plot(diffTable3$C ~ tempsC)

summary(lm(diffTable3$C ~ tempsC))
```

To predict each team's win percentage, one could take the host city's coldest average monthly low and multiply it by -0.005, then add this to 0.112.  This model and it's coefficients are significant, but only around 40% of the variation in the team's win percentage is explained by their winter temperatures.  Because of this low expanatory rate, I would never use this model to place sports bets.  I added another term to the model to show that good teams just play better regardless of weather, too.  The results of this is shown in the R output below.

```{r}
summary(lm(diffTable3$C ~ tempsC + diffTable3$N))
#summary(lm(diffTable3$H ~ tempsH))
#summary(lm(diffTable3$H ~ tempsH + diffTable3$N))
```

To predict each team's win percentage with this model, one could take the host city's coldest average monthly low and multiply it by -0.006 and add this to 0.134.  This model and it's coefficients are significant and now explains around 56% of the variation in the team's win percentage.  This is a little better, but I am still not sure if it is enough to use to gamble with. To determine a better prediction model, more variables and different types of models should be considered.


### Evaluation

For this project, I really wanted to focus on data visualization.  I referred to many online resources on how to customize graphs on ggplot.  I really hadn't customized a plot using ggplot this much before.  It was interesting to see how weather can affect team performance.  This project idea came to me after reading an article about home field advantage for teams who play in cities with cold winter weather.  However, this analysis showed that the Cleveland Browns are the worst team in cold weather over the past few years; I immediately thought that this is just because they were the worst team overall.  Because of this, I wanted to compare the team's record over this time with their record in extreme weather.  I did end up showing that the Browns do play worse in cold games, but there were many teams that were even worse.  A large majority of the time spent on this project was just getting the data to where I could work with it.  The next most time consuming part of this project with just customizing the ggplots to get it to answer my questions visually.
I do believe there are some limitations in this project.  If I am truly trying to predict outcomes of NFL games, I would need many more variables.  Also, since the NFL season is mainly in December, warm weather cities would never really get the chance to show their advantage in extreme heat.  Also, the hottest 1000 NFL games go down all the way to 73 degrees Fahrenheit, which really is not that extreme of heat.  The coldest games, again because the NFL mainly takes place in winter, go all the way down to near freezing temperatures.  Along with performing better in weather similar to the team's host city, I did not take into account teams just naturally playing better in home games (home field advantage).  It was also difficult to take into account indoor stadiums.  They were grouped in the normal temperature group, but I did not investigate what is called "dome-field advantage".  
Overall, I am happy with how this project went and I was happy to learn some more tools, especially in ggplot.  I learned how to do a ton of different customization on ggplots to get them to be how I want them to be.  I put in a lot of work in cleaning the data to get it to be workable.  My favorite part was combining a bar plot with a scatter plot to add deeper meaning to a graph. Although it was pretty simple, it was also nice to visualize the linear model and correlation of different variables. I always enjoy answering questions about sports performances that come through my head.
